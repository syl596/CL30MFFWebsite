# Project: NYUAD Campus Center Explorer

The project can be accessed [here](https://syl596.github.io/CL30MFFWebsite/).

Note: Images may take a bit of time to load—they will appear collapsed in the carousel when they are still loading. Google Chrome is recommended for an optimal experience.

## Project Description:

Created around a video that tours the NYUAD Campus Center, this project primarily functions as an informational website that provides details and images of the building’s various facilities and spaces. The website is composed of five pages—one Home page starring the video and four “floor” pages, each of which has information and a photo carousel dedicated to a floor of the building (Ground Floor, 1F, 2F, 3F). All the pages are connected by a navigation bar at the top and linked images at the bottom. The target audience would generally be off-campus visitors and people who would like to learn more about C2.

## Process:

The video that Saeed and I took for the 30MFF Video assignment was a brief tour of the Campus Center. As the website for this project had to be built around this video, I naturally decided on building an informational website about C2. I came up with the general composition of the website while working on the wireframe sketch—the biggest idea that came from this phase was that the site would be split up by each floor of the building.

I started by building the Home page—the video features prominently here and is visible the moment the user enters the website. The other major component that I added to this page below the video is a collection of linked images that takes the user to each floor (the corresponding page) of the building, which I was able to achieve by using the Flexbox module. I was also able to implement a fixed navigation bar at the top, which would be used alongside the linked images to connect the pages of the website. Clicking on the leftmost NYUAD logo also takes the user to the official NYUAD website, which further heightens this sense of connection.

The process for each of the four floor pages was similar in that it mainly involved 1) building a photo carousel featuring pictures of the floor (which I took myself), 2) writing a general description of the facilities and services offered by the floor, and 3) setting a trio of linked images that could take the user to another floor. 

As for the aesthetics of the website, I actually referred to the official NYUAD Brand Guidelines (which I found online [here](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyuad/news/documents/nyuad-brand-guidelines.pdf)) and took care to stick to the general rules that they delineated. This is most notable in how I used the font, colors, and patterns described and provided by the guide.

## Reflection/Evaluation:

Two of the biggest challenges I faced were figuring out how to set up the photo carousel and the fixed navigation bar at the top, which I was able to more or less solve at the end. One point I feel that I was unable to completely solve was in how I faced particular difficulty placing and adjusting the image of the NYUAD logo in the navigation bar—though I was able to make it work  and look fine for bigger window sizes, I feel that I could have done more to make it more fitting for all window sizes.

Though there are parts of the website that could have definitely used more time and polish, I feel that I was able to complete the project to the best of my ability and fulfill most of what I set out to do. As I started this project with only basic knowledge of and limited experience with HTML and CSS, I am proud that I was able to successfully create a functional website that carries out its original purpose (informing the user about the Campus Center through text, images, and a video) quite well. I have acquired a deeper grasp of how HTML and CSS work and gained the confidence to take on bigger website-building projects in the future.
